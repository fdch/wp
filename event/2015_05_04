<h5>*Gestus Kanto-GlyTkH* : THE UNAWAITED</h5>
<p>The gesture and what remains. The Noh-question. An image now dismantled by the voice. Inhabited deserts, deserted cities. Life more than a body. Blade color. A palo seco. Black sun of sound. Gravitational fall fades. The sound? When this was singing…</p>
<p>The Brazilian composer, cantoklast and performance artist based in Denmark Marcela Lucatelli has invited composers from both countries to create de-k(r)ompositional devices for her to perform the voice of the composer through. A voice without possession becoming the disjunction of the tessitura before what is called Kantar.</p>
<p>Premieres of works by Bernardo Barros, Jeppe Ernst, Martin Herraiz, Mathias Monrad Møller, Pedro Paulo Rocha and Rodolfo Valente.</p>
