<h5 class="concert-program">Event Info</h5>
<p>
Whilst all musical instruments suffer under layers of cultural, social and historical baggage, the tuba has perhaps more to deal with than most. The youngest orchestral instrument and thus the youngest instrument widely taught and played at a professional level, it has struggled to be taken seriously by much of the musical community since its invention some 180 years ago. Standards of tuba playing have improved exponentially worldwide over the last twenty years, but even when allowed to briefly escape making the opaque, indistinct sounds demanded from the tuba by modern orchestras, tubists tend to fill the role of a late-nineteenth century virtuoso. To try and build a new relationship between the tuba and the outside musical world, Jack Adler-McKean commissioned a series of works in 2015/16 for his microtonal tuba, a few of which will be performed tonight alongside works from previous decades by Dmitri Kourliandski and Georges Aperghis.

<p>
Following studies in Manchester (UK) and Hannover (DE), Jack Adler-McKean devotes his life to promoting the tuba to the outside world as a serious musical voice. His recent work features collaborations on solo works for microtonal tuba with Georges Aperghis, Michael Finnissy and Georg Freidrich Haas, projects with ensembles including Klangforum Wien, Kammerensemble Neue Musik Berlin and Staatstheatre Darmstadt (solo tuba/euphonium/alto trombone for Luigi Nono‘s “Promoteo“) and seminars at establishments including the University of Oxford, Royal College of Music and Columbia University. His orchestral work includes performances and recordings with the WDR Sinfonieorchester Köln, Hamburger Sinfoniker, Aalborg Sinfoniorkester and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestras under conductors such as Sir Simon Rattle, Donald Runnicles and Heinz Holliger, as well as with Spira Mirabilis, Kammerakademie Potsdam and the Berliner Domkantorei on the predecessors to the tuba, the serpent and the ophicleide. He is also currently assistant manager of LUCERNE FESTIVAL ALUMNI, plays dubstep sousaphone with the Hot Botz Brass Band, and his compositions and arrangements are published by Potenza Music.
