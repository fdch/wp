<h5 class="concert-program">Program:</h5>
<p>Timucin Sahin will join forces with two unique musicians; Cory Smythe on piano and Christopher Tordini on bass to perform his latest musical works.</p>
<p>Sahin has been recognized as one of today’s truly unique voices of  contemporary jazz music by publications such as San Francisco Bay Guardian, AllaboutJazz, Jazzwise, Downbeat and Jazz-Times as well as by many others. His unique sound on fretless electric guitar and his emotional content in his composing made him non-comparable and his music almost impossible to categorize.</p>
<p>His music is drawn from a wide body of knowledge and experience, often developed from his considerable skills as a guitarist. He employs improvisation but in ways hard to separate from the sound of his notated music.  His music is characterized by a delicacy of instrumental imagination and rhythmic structures, which have much flexibility though clearly pulse derived.
