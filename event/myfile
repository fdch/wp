Talea Ensemble	April 16th, 2015		Program:		Some say that a composer's unconscious state of mind finds ways to shape a composition. That may be true. Around the time Nose On Fire was conceived, my internal sound world was filled with a sense of urgency. So it's no surprise to me that my musical ideas were humming with anxiety. Originally, I titled it Sonata for Clarinet and Piano.
JUE WANG	Puppet Show		WANG JIE: "Nose on fire"		But towards the final week of completion, my dear friend Terry Tapp presented me with a portrait he drew of a horse with human eyes. The horse was illuminated by an internal glow and looked like it was feeling anxiety, seeking serenity and hoping to earn peace all at the same time. The feeling was so intense that the horse's snout was burning from within. "A creature after my own heart", I thought: "I'm calling it Nose On Fire." So I immediately changed the title of my new composition to reflect this happy coincidence. 
Iktus Percussion	April 17th, 2015		IOANNIS ANGELAKIS: "D R E A M P L A Y (III) : un court r&eacute;cit sur le voyage reveur d' Agn&eacute;s au pays des aelaT"		I am hopeful that after hearing it you'll agree with me that this composition, which begins from an anxious place, is driven to find that little bit of tenderness to relieve itself of that burden and earn peace.
The Soon Another	April 17th, 2015		TIMUCIN SAHIN: "Tikiti 2015"		"[I] attempted in this dream play to imitate the disconnected but apparently logical form of a dream. Anything can happen, everything is possible and probable. Space and time do not exist. Based on a slight foundation of reality, imagination wanders afield and weaves new patterns comprised of mixtures of recollections, experiences, unconstrained fantasies, absurdities and improvisations. Characters split, double and multiply; they evaporate, crystallize, dissolve, and reconverge. But one single consciousness governs them all, that of the dreamer. For him, there are no secrets, no incongruities, no scruples, and no laws. And since there is more pain than pleasure in the dream, a tone of melancholy and sympathy for all things runs through the swaying narrative. Sleep, the liberator, is often tortuous; and yet when pain is at its worst, the sufferer is wakened and reconciled with reality. For however agonizing reality may be, it is, at this moment, when compared with the torments of the dream, a joy".</br>
Ensemble Mise-en	April 18th, 2015		for 7 string fretless & 6 string fretted guitars, percussions, piano, clarinet, flute, violin and cello		Guitars will be perfomed by the composer.
Marcella Lucatelli	May 4th, 2015		GORDON BEEFERMAN: "RITES OF SUMMER (East Coast Version) 2007/2015" *NY Premiere 		RITES OF SUMMER is a lengthy work for sextet I composed in 2007 for the Los Angeles-based California EAR Unit on commission from 20th Century Unlimited. My idea was to write something sprawling, like L.A. itself, something that moves in gigantic strides with sunny clarity but dark, craggy desert undertones. For this concert, I've radically cut and re-worked the piece to fit a New York sensibility: short, impatient, and to the point. Hence, "East Coast Version." I think of this piece as an imaginary ballet; what the "rites" are I don't want to suggest, but I hope the music will conjure up something different for everyone.
Mirjam Frank	May 5th, 2015		Program:		Movement I: It's me! (silent puppetry)<br/>Movement II: The Shadow <br/>Movement III: My Words.<br/>Puppeteers: Joshua Hudelson, Joseph Pfender.<br/>This is not merely a concert piece, but a fun show for young and old audiences! The piece depicts a lonely girl who hides in her own private space playing by herself. Let her walk you through her thoughts, her dreams and her sounds! 
Dafna Naphtali + Hans Tammen	May 9th, 2015		JOEL RUST: "Infernal Jukebox", for four glockenspiels		Before its more prosaic reality came along, futurologists talked about the 'celestial jukebox' - a device that would be able to instantly play any song, anywhere in the world. I imagine that its counterpart, the infernal jukebox, would play chromatic scales and clusters on four glockenspiels; this is what this piece does.
Arthur Kampela	October 16th, 2015		FEDE CAMARA HALAC: "Huesos / Bones", for four percussionists		"Bones" is the first part of the "Songs for the Dead" cycle. Time and activity within this cycle come from different expressions of randomness applied to different sets of sounds, resulting in similar stationary states. Within this percussion piece, the players engage with sound mostly through the bones of their hands and arms, exploring the notion of space between surface and body, both of the player who is in contact with the sound source and of the listener who experiences sound through the air in the room.
Takao Hyakutome	November 4th, 2015		MOON YOUNG HA: "slow music i", for amplified percussion quartet with electronics		In this piece I am experimenting with texture, space and color (both visually and musically) through the integration of pop idioms, minimalism and live electronic manipulation.  Written for electric guitar, piano and live electronics, ColorWHEEL is a meditation, an experiment, and an extension of what we normally play as a band.  While it's not New Music per se, it's certainly a new direction for us. Performed by Felipe Wurst and <a href="adele_fourner.php">Adele Fournet</a>, members of <a href="http://www.thesoonanother.com" target="_blank" title="www.thesoonanother.com">The Soon-Another</a>.
Takao Hyakutome and Joan Bagés i Rubí	November 5th, 2015		Program:		HABITATS (Three movements, nonet version)<br/>
Violin + electronics + improvisation	November 6th, 2015		Adele Fournet with The Soon-Another: "ColorWHEEL"		hex begins as hex in the sense of six - a relatively conventional sextet piece, exploring different combinations of its instruments and developing its material - but gradually becomes hex in the sense of a curse - with mysterious power, and an unhappy ending.
Takao Hyakutome	November 9th, 2015		Program:		The philosopher Gilles Deleuze was fascinated by Turner's "explosive lines without contour", for him Turner's paintings aren't "about catastrophes" but instead become catastrophes in themselves and for those who view them. For the mathematician Ren&eacute; Thom catastrophes are bifurcations between different equilibria. The catastrophe is permanent: the edge of a table, where the wood becomes air, is a surface of separation, is a place of catastrophe. Every folding and unfolding is a catastrophe. What would one say about the birth and destruction of musical forms? What is the physical catastrophe that underlines figuration? Or even... "catastrophe... in the old sense... to be buried alive in lava and not turn a hair, it is then a man shows what stuff he is made of" (Malone Dies, Beckett).
Mei Ann Teo\n	December 4th, 2015\n		GORDON BEEFERMAN: "HABITATS 2011/2012"		"Flesh" is the third and last part of the "Songs for the Dead" cycle. Time and activity within this cycle come from different expressions of randomness applied to different sets of sounds, resulting in similar stationary states. The nervous iridiscence of the gestures contraposed to extremely slow processes result in a kind of formal stasis, a motion leading nowhere and anywhere at the same time, moving inwardly and outwardly but remaining in the same place.
			JOEL RUST: "hex", for cor anglais, bassoon, horn, trumpet, viola and cello		Winterreisen encapsulates journeys- moments of ecstasy, of despair, and paths of transitions in between. Beyond a simple descriptive musical illustration of thoughts and emotions, I found that these images demanded for a new extended palette of colors and sounds. This sonic expansion of musical parameters is reflected in my work- after developing a roadmap for the electronic part, I followed by composing ideas for acoustic instruments. I had a clear concept in the beginning, delineating form and musical shape. Shortly after, I was able to move away from the initial plan and compose freely- a moment of intense artistic freedom. Patience for the change of seasons from a hostile environment to a fruitful period is akin to the self-restraint of an artistically productive time: I cocooned myself in the cloisters of my musical realm. Ultimately, this composition reflects moments of genesis; in this piece, I celebrate the rejuvenation of thoughts and the discovery of spring, elements of freedom shared with an audience, through music.
			BERNARDO BARROS: "catastrophe"		The gesture and what remains. The Noh-question. An image now dismantled by the voice. Inhabited deserts, deserted cities. Life more than a body. Blade color. A palo seco. Black sun of sound. Gravitational fall fades. The sound? When this was singing…
			FEDE CAMARA HALAC: "Flesh / Carne", for bass clarinet, cello, doublebass, percussion and piano		The Brazilian composer, cantoklast and performance artist based in Denmark Marcela Lucatelli has invited composers from both countries to create de-k(r)ompositional devices for her to perform the voice of the composer through. A voice without possession becoming the disjunction of the tessitura before what is called Kantar.
			FRIEDRICH KERN: "Winterreisen"		Premieres of works by Bernardo Barros, Jeppe Ernst, Martin Herraiz, Mathias Monrad Møller, Pedro Paulo Rocha and Rodolfo Valente.
			Program: Download the print version <a href="graphics/program-lucatelli.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>		The programme I am compiling consists of four pieces: two scenes from <i>L' Incoronazione di Poppea</i> by Claudio Monteverdi (c. 1643), <i>Aria</i> by John Cage (1958) and <i>Stripsody</i> by Cathy Berberian (1966). They are separated by over 300 years, yet all have in common a personal drama unfolding through 'musical monologues'. My aim is to form one coherent piece, i.e., to perform the programme without the pauses that are typically used during a recital to switch characters between songs. I often find these 'switches' somewhat problematic because the performer usually falls into 'private mode' for a while, which can at times be distracting. Instead, I want to tell one story, and therefore guide the audience through one character's drama, rather than presenting four different destinies. I have been interested in doing such a programme for a long time because, as a singer, I always try to understand a piece of vocal music from a character's inner motivation to act, rather than through the more external aspects alone (such as style, period, etc.). Vocal compositions, no matter what era they stem from, have in common the human being as actor, and the voice as vehicle, the function and quality of which has not changed in hundreds of years (as opposed to the development of instruments)
			*Gestus Kanto-GlyTkH* : THE UNAWAITED		Cathy Berberian (1925-1983), Luciano Berio's wife, was one of the most versatile singers of her time. Cage's Aria was in fact written for her. She was an exquisite performer of both contemporary and early music, and sang all pieces that appear in this programme. Particularly her interpretations of Monteverdi and her album of Beatles songs in 'baroque style' demonstrate(d) how 'contemporary' 17th Century music indeed is.
			Program:		Mechanique(s) duo is composed and improvised music by Dafna Naphtali and Hans Tammen -- live computer-based electronics and audio processing, “endangered” guitar and voice. In their active collaboration since 1998, the duo probes and playfully under- mines the overlap of various elements of their technical and aesthetic practices, in compositions and improvisations for Naphtali's interactive processed sound/noise system and 4-octave vocal range, and Tammen's mechanical and energetic laptop manipulations of modified guitars.
			Monodrama - Hommage &agrave; Cathy Berberian		During their performances, Naphtali uses her custom Max/MSP programs (that she has been writing and adjusting since 1993) to filter/sample and otherwise mutate her voice as well Tammens’ sounds (and that of all the other musicians with whom they perform). She then plays those sounds as a new instrument of her own invention, at times as a curious accompaniment to her voice. They have focused on the relationship of these prepared sounds to her electronic sounds, and at times they generate strikingly similar timbres with completely divergent means. Tammen mechanically and Naphtali by the physical constructs of her electronic processes.
			Dafna Naphtali - live sound processing & voice		Hans Tammen uses a wide array of mechanical preparations for guitar(including brushes, small stones, a small electric fan, a cigarette lighters, an Ebow and chopsticks) that are processed in completely other and more personal ways with his own custom Max/MSP programs and with his unusual take on guitar-based control -- and then heightened by his unique sensibility as an improviser -- often setting the duo on a crazed collision course of the acoustic and the electronic – all along the route paying homage (in a twirl of the radio dial) to music concrete, free jazz and European improvised music, as well as the contemporary classical and all manner of non-Western musics.
			Hans Tammen - endangered guitar		The audio processing algorithms they each use are as varied as the possible musical gestures, registers, and density of musical sounds they make. In each section a different kind of audio processing transformation is employed, and so always an element of surprise is in it for each of them, as they listen and adjust our phrases, timing and sound and as the audio processing transforms our individual sounds.
