<h5>Lecture | Recital</h5>
<p>UMS 'n JIP, voice-recorder duo from Switzerland, is giving a lecture recital with works by Luis Cofera, Panayiotis Kokoras, George Aperghis, Adam Roberts, Du Yun and Javier Hagen. With their unique instrumentation, they are also going to talk about their ongoing research project and discuss anything that you are curious about them! </p>
<p>UMS 'n JIP ['umsnjip]. Founded by Ulrike Mayer-Spohn [UMS] and Javier Hagen [JIP/Javier-Ignacio Palau-Ribes], UMS 'n JIP is one of the most active and experienced contemporary music ensembles worldwide involved in >100 international events annually, including mobile chamber operas & multimedia performances. They can look back on more than 700 concerts and 150 commissioned works since 2007.</p>
<p>UMS 'n JIP explore new musical and scenic settings for voice, recorders and electronics ranging from live to digital performance as well as European and non-European music. Collaboration providing common research, rehearsals and recordings with the individual composers over several years as well as an exceptionally high number of performances all around the world mean that the works commissioned by UMS 'n JIP are among the most often performed compositions by such composers. Although UMS ’n JIP do handle an impressive workload, their aim is not to premiere as much as possible but to perform new works as often as possible - since works basically grow by being performed.</p>
<p>Since their studies (composition, audio design & musical performance) in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Switzerland, UMS and JIP have been invited to prestigious contemporary music and theatre festivals (Avignon, Paris, Marseille, Zürich, Lausanne, Lucerne, Basel, Bern, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Ulan Bator, Seoul, Tokyo, Buenos Aires, Adelaide, New York, Donaueschingen, Stuttgart, Karlsruhe, Berlin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Riga, Barcelona, Valencia, Sevilla, Athens, Thessaloniki, Istanbul, Cairo) where they have premiered more than 200 works as soloists and as a duo, collaborating with both world famous and aspiring young composers such as Heiner Goebbels, Wolfgang Rihm, Mauricio Kagel, Aribert Reimann, Peter Eötvös, Luis Codera Puzo, Erik Ona, Vladimir Gorlinsky, Chikashi Miyama, Huang Ruo, Wen Deqing and Guo Wenjing. </p>
