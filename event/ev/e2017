<code>
CONCEPT: Incidental 1.accompanying but not a major part of something. 2. liable to happen as a consequence of (an activity). Thinking that noise is everywhere already, what is an afternoon like this adding to? In which ways it can be different from human in locus noise observation? A room for the devotional experience of practicing miscommunication, where the participant performers are encouraged to interact sound-wise with each other and the audience in riotous ways not expected to be serialised or logically assimilated. Maybe we can hear it then.

SOUND: There are 8 performers in a room with 8 speakers. Spread throughout the room there are 8 small contact mics, with which the performers can interact with. The speaker and the mics can also be used as percussive instruments.  Each contact mic will send its signal to the remaining 7 speakers, and this signal will be constantly fed back and looped randomly. The spatialization of the overall noise will thus depend on the feedback position and its volume will be mostly loud. In addition, there is a microphone in the room that any performer can use to perform a solo.

LIGHTS: there are 2 projectors covering as much of the room as possible. There will be curves and points of different lenght, directions and positions reacting to the signals. At first onlt white, simple shapes will be projected on the dark background, and will eventually change into colored, more complex ones.

<h3>TUBA THURSDAY: Jack Adler-McKean</h3>
<h4>February 14th, 2017</h4>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1264922603594661"><img style="width:50%" src="https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/15965246_2044517265775148_4940489520821107125_n.jpg?oh=ddb1d38b3042dde391a9597cc8d4cf24&oe=594483FE" title="Navarro, Kashtin and Djenoun."/></a>
<h5 class="concert-program">Jack Adler-McKean, Tuba</h5>

<h5 class="concert-program">Event Info</h5>
<p>
Whilst all musical instruments suffer under layers of cultural, social and historical baggage, the tuba has perhaps more to deal with than most. The youngest orchestral instrument and thus the youngest instrument widely taught and played at a professional level, it has struggled to be taken seriously by much of the musical community since its invention some 180 years ago. Standards of tuba playing have improved exponentially worldwide over the last twenty years, but even when allowed to briefly escape making the opaque, indistinct sounds demanded from the tuba by modern orchestras, tubists tend to fill the role of a late-nineteenth century virtuoso. To try and build a new relationship between the tuba and the outside musical world, Jack Adler-McKean commissioned a series of works in 2015/16 for his microtonal tuba, a few of which will be performed tonight alongside works from previous decades by Dmitri Kourliandski and Georges Aperghis.
</p>
<h5 class="concert-program">Program</h5>
<ul>
<li>Steven Daverson: Arkanar: A Report from the Interior (2016)
</li><li>Dmitri Kourliandski: tube space (2008)
</li><li>Emily Howard: Chaos or Chess (2016)
</li><li>Evan Johnson: Rückenfigur (2016)
</li><li>Georges Aperghis: Ruinen (1994)
</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="concert-program">Bio</h5>
<p>
Following studies in Manchester (UK) and Hannover (DE), Jack Adler-McKean devotes his life to promoting the tuba to the outside world as a serious musical voice. His recent work features collaborations on solo works for microtonal tuba with Georges Aperghis, Michael Finnissy and Georg Freidrich Haas, projects with ensembles including Klangforum Wien, Kammerensemble Neue Musik Berlin and Staatstheatre Darmstadt (solo tuba/euphonium/alto trombone for Luigi Nono‘s “Promoteo“) and seminars at establishments including the University of Oxford, Royal College of Music and Columbia University. His orchestral work includes performances and recordings with the WDR Sinfonieorchester Köln, Hamburger Sinfoniker, Aalborg Sinfoniorkester and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestras under conductors such as Sir Simon Rattle, Donald Runnicles and Heinz Holliger, as well as with Spira Mirabilis, Kammerakademie Potsdam and the Berliner Domkantorei on the predecessors to the tuba, the serpent and the ophicleide. He is also currently assistant manager of LUCERNE FESTIVAL ALUMNI, plays dubstep sousaphone with the Hot Botz Brass Band, and his compositions and arrangements are published by Potenza Music.

In the past, he's had the privilege to study with Rand Steiger at UC San Diego, and Robert Kyr at the University of Oregon. Bean is momentarily devoted to authoring an automated music notation software called d-nm (dynamic notation for music) for iPads, which allows performers to interact dynamically with musical scores throughout their learning and performance processes.
