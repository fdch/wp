<img src="../img/2015-2016/jip-thumb.jpg"/>
<h5>Lecture | Recital</h5>
<p>UMS 'n JIP, voice-recorder duo from Switzerland, is giving a lecture recital with works by Luis Cofera, Panayiotis Kokoras, George Aperghis, Adam Roberts, Du Yun and Javier Hagen. With their unique instrumentation, they are also going to talk about their ongoing research project and discuss anything that you are curious about them! </p>
<p>UMS 'n JIP ['umsnjip]. Founded by Ulrike Mayer-Spohn [UMS] and Javier Hagen [JIP/Javier-Ignacio Palau-Ribes], UMS 'n JIP is one of the most active and experienced contemporary music ensembles worldwide involved in >100 international events annually, including mobile chamber operas & multimedia performances. They can look back on more than 700 concerts and 150 commissioned works since 2007.</p>
<p>UMS 'n JIP explore new musical and scenic settings for voice, recorders and electronics ranging from live to digital performance as well as European and non-European music. Collaboration providing common research, rehearsals and recordings with the individual composers over several years as well as an exceptionally high number of performances all around the world mean that the works commissioned by UMS 'n JIP are among the most often performed compositions by such composers. Although UMS ’n JIP do handle an impressive workload, their aim is not to premiere as much as possible but to perform new works as often as possible - since works basically grow by being performed.</p>
<p>Since their studies (composition, audio design & musical performance) in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Switzerland, UMS and JIP have been invited to prestigious contemporary music and theatre festivals (Avignon, Paris, Marseille, Zürich, Lausanne, Lucerne, Basel, Bern, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Ulan Bator, Seoul, Tokyo, Buenos Aires, Adelaide, New York, Donaueschingen, Stuttgart, Karlsruhe, Berlin, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Riga, Barcelona, Valencia, Sevilla, Athens, Thessaloniki, Istanbul, Cairo) where they have premiered more than 200 works as soloists and as a duo, collaborating with both world famous and aspiring young composers such as Heiner Goebbels, Wolfgang Rihm, Mauricio Kagel, Aribert Reimann, Peter Eötvös, Luis Codera Puzo, Erik Ona, Vladimir Gorlinsky, Chikashi Miyama, Huang Ruo, Wen Deqing and Guo Wenjing. </p>
<p>UMS 'n JIP are also involved in the direction of the Swiss Contemporary Music Festival Forum : : Wallis, chaired by the International Society for Contemporary Music Wallis/Switzerland IGNM-VS. JIP is the current president of ISCM Switzerland as well as board member of the European Conference of Promoters of New Music ECPNM, Swissfestivals and of the UNESCO Commission for the Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage in the Canton of Valais. Within these structures, UMS 'n JIP have initiated more than 200 additional projects and commissions. Since 2013 UMS 'n JIP have taken part in two international research projects: The Recorder Map and i-Treasures. The duo are coached by Irvine Arditti, leader of the world renowned London-based Arditti Quartet.

</ul>

<p><i>"very impressive, visceral yet also cerebral and feisty...".</i><br/>
<b>Downbeat</b>  </p>
<p><i>“There is a lot going on in Sahin's ample assortment of tones and experimentation and his approach to composition and performance necessitates active involvement. But to apply a one-time film student's simile, it is like delving into a David Lynch or Atom Egoyan movie: on subsequent tries understanding and insight start to occur.“</i><br/>
<b>Audiophile audition</b></p> 
<p><i>"Coming to New York by way of Holland from Turkey, Sahin is right in the free jazz thick of things as he might be an ax man but he composes for an Ornette Coleman comeback, and we don’t mean smooth jazz style. Polyrhymic with a rocker’s core, this is certainly for the left leaning, sitting down jazz fan that appreciates a good amphetamine rush along the way."</i><br/>

<h3>Presentation: Georgina Born </h3>
<h4>October 12th, 2016</h4>
<h4>10:00-12:00 am</h4>
<a href="../img/2016-2017/born.jpg"><img src="../img/2016-2017/born.jpg"/></a>
<h5 class="concert-program">Description: “Beyond the Sound Object: on nonhuman sound”</h5>
<p>
On Wednesday October 12th, professor of Music and Anthropology Georgina Born (Oxford University) will be a guest speaker at NYU as part of Waverly Project’s annual program of talks, masterclasses, and concerts. Professor Born will present new work that considers the ways in which sounds forge relations across yawning divides between human and non-human agents. Grounded in recent post-humanist theory and philosophy of sound, Born’s story draws from a provocative pair of auto-ethnographic accounts: a violent rainstorm in Cambridge, and the quieter environs of a hospital room, the site of her mother’s last days and death.
</p>
<p>
All are welcome, though to facilitate discussion participation is limited to 20. A final draft of the paper will be circulated to attendees in advance. To avoid disappointment, please RSVP as soon as possible by emailing joe.snape@nyu.edu, including your name, department, and program of study. Please feel free to circulate this email among your own networks.
</p>
<h5 class="concert-program">BIOGRAPHY</h5>
<p>
Georgina Born is Professor of Music and Anthropology at Oxford University and a Professorial Fellow of Mansfield College. Previously she was Professor of Sociology, Anthropology and Music at Cambridge University and a Professorial Fellow of Girton College Cambridge. Earlier in her life she worked as a musician on cello and bass guitar, performing with the group Henry Cow, as well as with the Art Bears, the Mike Westbrook Orckestra, the Michael Nyman Band and other ensembles, as well as playing improvised music in various combinations as a member of the London Musicians’ Collective. She studied Anthropology at University College London at BSc and PhD levels, being awarded her PhD in 1989 for an ethnography of IRCAM, the computer music institute in Paris, a study that became her first book.
</p>
<p>
Georgina Born’s work combines ethnographic and theoretical writings on music, media and cultural production. Her ethnographies have often focused on major institutions – television production at the BBC, computer music at IRCAM, interdisciplinary art-science and new media art at the University of California, Irvine. Her books are Rationalizing Culture: IRCAM, Boulez, and the Institutionalization of the Musical Avant-Garde (California 1995), Western Music and Its Others: Difference, Representation, and Appropriation in Music (edited with David Hesmondhalgh, California 2000), and Uncertain Vision: Birt, Dyke and the Reinvention of the BBC(Vintage 2005). Two edited books were published in 2013: Music, Sound and Space: Transformations of Public and Private Experience (Cambridge 2013), andInterdisciplinarity: Reconfigurations of the Social and Natural Sciences (edited with Andrew Barry, Routledge 2013). From 2010 to 2015 Born is directing the research programme ‘Music, Digitisation, Mediation: Towards Interdisciplinary Music Studies’, funded by the European Research Council, which examines the transformation of music and musical practices by digitisation and digital media through comparative ethnographies in seven countries in the developing and developed world.
</p>
<p>
From 2013 to 2015 she holds the Schulich Distinguished Visiting Professorship and Dean’s Chair in Music in the Schulich School of Music at McGill University, Montreal, and in spring semester 2014 she held the Bloch Distinguished Visiting Professorship in the Department of Music, University of California, Berkeley. She has been a visiting professor in the Department of Film Studies and Audiovisual Culture at Masaryk University, Czech Republic, and a visiting professor in the Department of Social Anthropology, University of Stockholm. In spring 2015 she gave the British Academy Radcliffe-Brown Lecture in Social Anthropology. She has been appointed an Honorary Professor at University College London, in the Department of Anthropology (2015-19).

<h3>Rage Thormbones present Ciudad Invertida</h3>
<h4>November 17th, 2016</h4>
<a href="../img/2016-2017/ciudad_invertida.jpg"><img src="../img/2016-2017/ciudad_invertida.jpg"/></a>
<h5 class="concert-program"><a href="http://www.ragethormbones.rocks/" target="_blank">Rage Thormbones</a></h5>
<p>RAGE THORMBONES IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN TROMBONISTS MATT BARBIER AND WESTON OLENCKI. IT IS A BLOG RESOURCE, A COMMISSIONING RESOURCE, AN ANNOYING RESOURCE, AND A RESOURCE THAT CONSISTENTLY PUSHES THE EXTREMES OF BRASS TECHNIQUES. RAGE HAS RECORDED FOR HATHUT RECORDS AND WILL BE IN RESIDENCE AT BOTH HARVARD AND STANFORD UNIVERSITIES IN 2017.
</p>
<h5 class="concert-program">Program:</h5>

<p><a href="http://www.fedecamarahalac.com/ciudad.php" target="_blank">Ciudad Invertida</a> (Inverted City) is a work that seeks to raise questions about chance and interactivity in the multiplicity of the media involved. Just as live electronics propagates multiple extensions of the actions of the trombone, an algorithm was constructed as a source of material and form during the process of composition. The video is projected onto the body of the trombonists and controlled live by the audio signal they produce. The images are abstractions, both of the instrumentalists and the city of Cordoba that surrounds this room.

<h3>Nils Vigelands : Presentation on his works</h3>
<h4>November 30th, 2016</h4>
<a href="../img/2016-2017/vigeland.jpg"><img src="../img/2016-2017/vigeland.jpg"/></a>
<h5 class="concert-program">Program:</h5>
<p>Nils Vigeland was born in Buffalo, NY in 1950, the son of musicians. He made his professional debut as a pianist in 1969 with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, Lukas Foss, conductor. He later studied composition with Foss at Harvard College, graduating with a B.A. in 1972. He earned his Ph.D at The University at Buffalo where he studied composition with Morton Feldman and piano with Yvar Mikhashoff. With these mentors he was fortunate in developing long personal and professional associations.
</p>
<p>
His first orchestral piece was conducted by Foss with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra in 1970 and Foss gave the first performance of One, Three, Five with the Milwaikee Symphony Orchestra in 1983.
Mikhashoff was instrumental in the comission and performance of many pieces, including the Piano Concerto (1984), premiered by Mikhashoff  and the Oslo Radio Orchestra, Christian Eggen, conductor, In Black and White for piano and chamber orchestra and False Love/True Love (1992), premiered by the English National Opera at the Almeida Theater, London.
</p>
<p>
With Eberhard Blum, flute and Jan Williams, percussion, Vigeland toured for eight years with Feldman as “Morton Feldman and Solists”, performing the extended length works for flute, percusion and piano that Feldman composed for them. They recorded these pieces on HAT ART.
</p>
<p>
For eight years (1980-89) Mr. Vigeland directed The Bowery Ensemble which gave an annual series of concerts in Cooper Union, NYC. The ensemble was strongly associated with the music of the New York School and gave the first performance of over thirty works by composers including Pauline Oliveros, Christian Wolf, Leo Smit, Chris Newman and John Thow.
His own work appears on CDs from Mode, EMF, Focus, Lovely Music, and Naxos. His choral music is published by Boosey and Hawkes. He taught at Manhattan School of Music for thirty years, retiring as Chair of the Composition Department in 2013.

<h3>"They Shoot Lasers, Don't They? Electronic Music with Instruments of Interferometry"</h3>
<h4>December 2nd, 2016</h4>
<a href="../img/2016-2017/cresota.jpg"><img src="../img/2016-2017/cresota.jpg"/></a>
<h5>Duo Creosota: Joe Mariglio and Adam Tinkle</h5>
<h5 class="concert-program">Program:</h5>
<p>They Shoot Lasers, Don't They?: Electronic Music with Instruments of Interferometry employs a sculptural assemblage of balloons, transducers, vibrated water, and an overhead projector to create a visceral audio-visual experience evocative of 60s liquid visuals and Kubrickian space travel. Developed out of Joe Mariglio's doctoral research and inveterate penchant for instrument invention, the piece explores the musical applications of laser microphones--little used in the arts and most famous as Cold War-era spy tools-- to probe and activate a multisensory continuum of vibration, invoking cymatics and inducing feedback that freely crosses back and forth between forms of energy--light, water waves, sparkling rhythms, blistering tones, and the tactile heave of the lower frequencies.
</p>
<p>
Adam Tinkle is a multidisciplinary artist teaching at Skidmore College. Interested in immersion, transformation and the audio-visionary, he works in sound, intermedia, performance, and participatory/collaborative modalities. Trained in music, his practice remains grounded in reverence for the moment, whether he is improvising on the saxophone, constructing unstable electronic systems, DJing on the radio, or singing American song form musics. Recent collaborations include a tasting-concert with Chris Kallmyer/Machine Project, a sound installation produced with performance art icon Marina Abramovic, and a radio play with science fiction novelist Kim Stanley Robinson. He records (and tweets) for the netlabel Risky Forager, holds a PhD from UC San Diego, and has been published in Leonardo Music Journal and Organised Sound.
</p>
<p>
Joe Mariglio is a sound artist and inventor based in San Diego, CA. A doctoral candidate at UCSD, his academic work focuses on the application of nonlinear systems to sound synthesis and analysis. As a software engineer specializing in audio, he has contributed to the Microsoft HoloLens project, and is currently working at Go Pro. As a sound artist, his work spans popular and experimental forms, including ambient, noise, and drone genres, and typically explores materiality, immersion, and the abject. 
</p>
<p>
As the duo Creosota, Joe and Adam's collaboration began at Wesleyan University, where both studied composition with Alvin Lucier, Anthony Braxton, and Ron Kuivila. Moving to the West Coast, they released a tape of folk music made with custom software, co-founded the Universal Language Orchestra (a children's ensemble that composed its own scores and built its own instruments) and presented sound art works--usually some combination of sculptural, durational, and interactive--at venues ranging from the San Diego Museum of Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, Stanford University, and the Institute of Perception, as well as a permanent installation at the Media Arts Center, San Diego.
