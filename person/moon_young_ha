<p>Moon Young HA has spent the past years working to redefine the new music scene in New York. As the founder and director of ensemble mise-en, Moon curates and conducts some of the most unexpected, perplexing, and widely noticed concerts of contemporary classical music in the city today. As a composer, Moon's works are heard worldwide, commissioned by major ensembles and chamber orchestras, and featured prominently in experimental collaborations with the musicians of New York-based ensemble mise-en.</p>
<p>As artistic director of ensemble mise-en, Moon has debuted works by composers of international repute alongside those lesser known or under-played. During the past season, US and New York premiers have included woks by Bent Sorensen, Younghi Pagh-Paan, Isang Yun, Hans Abrahamsen, Kaija Saariaho and Wolfram Schurig; a concert-length collaboration with composer Wolfgang Mitterer on the debut of his piece "REMIX_2#" at Le Poission Rouge, and debuts of over two-dozen pieces by composers from the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p>Moon's compositional output is as eclectic as the concerts he curates. Much of his work combines acoustic instruments with electronics, video, and choreography, reflecting sundry influences from western, non-western, jazz, and pop idioms. The New York Times called his music "a wayward litany of pops, shivers and shrieks, by turns agitated and enervated". But his work also emphasizes organic development, narrative structure, and close research into spectral combinations, creating audible story lines that delight the senses and spur the imagination. In the past years, Moon's works have been premiered by groups such as the International Contemporary Ensemble, Alarm Will Sound, Empyrean Ensemble, Chatham Baroque, Momenta Quartet and others. Moon has recently done residencies at I-Park, Kimmel Harding Nelson Center for the Arts, Omi International Arts Center, and was guest composer at the Intimacy of Creativity Project at Hong Kong University of Science & Technology.</p>
<p>Originally from Seoul, South Korea, Moon lives and works in New York City. He received degrees (B.M., M.M.) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and is currently pursuing his Ph.D. at New York University, where he teaches music theory and composition. </p>
