<p>Jue Wang is a composer based in New York City. Her recent compositions have focused on expanding the theatrical dimension of musical performance. She also explores other dramatic forms of performance including magic shows, puppetry and 3D projection. In 2014 she composed a work of immersive musical theater titled It’s a Secret Performance as a collaboration with composer Adam Mirza and other musicians. </p>
<p>Her next immersive theatrical project, titled Bedroom Performance, will bring together these theatrical and magical elements; it will be presented in a personal space, possibly in her own apartment! </p>
<p>Ms. Wang has also been working on projects with children in the age range of 6 to 12. Her academic research exams children's relation to contemporary abstract sound and music. She is interested in bringing young performers and audiences into the experience of contemporary classical performance.  </p>
<p>Ms. Wang has been honored with performances of her music throughout China, United States and Europe by ensembles including Jack Quartet, Momenta Quartet, Loadbang, Orchestra of the League of Composers, Krulik Quartet and the vocalist Thomas Buckner.  A review by Cleveland Classical in 2012 has described her as “having a sensitive ear and original voice ... is surely someone we will be hearing much about in the future”.  In the same year, her chamber opera, Scholar, Monk, Snake, was selected by the Center for Contemporary Opera to be performed in NYC. </p>
<p>Jue received her B.M. degree at Oberlin Conservatory, studied composition with Professor Lewis Nielson and piano with Lydia Frumkin. Currently, she is studying at New York University in the composition doctoral program with Professor Louis Karchin, Jamie Oliver and Elizabeth Hoffman.  </p>
