Fede Camara Halac studied music composition at the National University of Cordoba. He is a PhD candidate in music composition at NYU GSAS with Jaime Oliver, Elizabeth Hoffman and Louis Karchin. His research focuses on the intersections and hybridity between multimedia: live electronics, amplification, electroacoustic, field recordings, improvisation, notation, video, live video, programming, chaos, performance, documentary, film, art and life. The musical outcome of this research calls for an immersive conception of the concert experience, where the score, its performance and the work --as idealization of meaning within the frame of a music piece-- are historical elements representing a process --i.e., experience feeding into the work-- which is presenting itself as life. The works/pieces/unworks are fully documented as score (combining graphic and traditional notation, improvisation, performance and technical instructions, etc.), as audio file from the live performance, and as a film (a third videographic work composed of an edition of the footage obtained during the concert), thus interpreting the concert experience as the shooting of a film with a live audience. http://fdch.github.io/tv
