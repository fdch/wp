Joe Snape (1989) mixes conventional and homemade instruments with light and text to make unusual and moving performances. His work – featured in The Guardian and described by Fluid Radio as ‘joyous and beautiful’ – has been presented at venues like Café Oto (London), Wonder Site (Tokyo), Mayhem (Copenhagen), Melkweg (Amsterdam), Quiet Cue (Berlin), and The Kitchen (NYC). His work has appeared on BBC 6 Music, Resonance FM and NTS Radio, and is published by the Slip, Kesh and Ono imprints. For 2015-16 he’s a UK Young Artist and a nominee for The Arts Foundation’s Creative Producer fellowship.
Joe studied music at Cambridge, Oxford, and the Institute of Sonology, spent time at University of California Berkeley, and holds a PhD fellowship at New York University, where he writes about instruments with which music was never made. Since 2010, he’s been stockpiling Russian light bulbs and burning his fingers with a soldering iron. He hails from the great industrial city of Birmingham, England, and lives in London and New York City.
