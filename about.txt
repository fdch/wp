Waverly Project is a platform for presenting the output of composers at NYU in any form. In addition, WP is an annual programming initiative that, for the season 2016-17, is presenting 6 visiting artists in concert in New York City. The seriesâ€™ mission is to present exciting new music from outside of the city, to offer rising artists a NYC premiere, and to forge new, international links between a generation of emerging musicians.
